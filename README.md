# Advent-of-Code
My solutions for http://adventofcode.com programming puzzles. I try to solve these with just Java, without any external libraries or dependencies. Year 2017 was the first time I tried to actively use functional elements that came in java 8, sometimes using them even if imperative version was easier.

Most of the time, solutions are just the first thing that came to my mind and might not be optimized and they are badly documented. Sometimes though, they use the supposed "trick" that was to be used for that day. 


# Dependencides

This uses a my own library to fetch the input. The library is not included here, but a separate link will be posted here: TODO


### A solution does not work?
Might be an edge-case for some inputs! Open an issue and I might look into it.
